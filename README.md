<h2 align="center">About me</h2>

I am Dimitri, a Junior DevOps Specialist @ fintus. Outside the office I like to spend even more of my time around computers, currently I mostly enjoy working on websites using frameworks like react or vue in my spare time but I also work on different projects like CLIs to make support my workflow or tinker with linux machines.

When spending time away from my Code Editor I like to dive into video games of all sorts but mostly story rich RPG games and I love watching movies and reading books.

ðŸ“– I'm currently honing my skills with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Go](https://go.dev)

<br />

  <p>Disclaimer: I'm not a god at all of these technologies, I use whatever solves the issue at hand and some of these weren't used in a long time. But I know where to find the information and after a while of re-learning I'm good to go again.</p>

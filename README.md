## Hi there, I'm Dimitri

I'm currently a devops engineer in Germany. 
You can find some of my non-commercial work here, from trying out new tech/languages to some bigger projects.

#### A bit about me
- I'm mostly working with **go**, **c** and **lua**
- Tech I'm using the most is Kubernetes, Jenkins and Docker
- Currently learning more about **c** and **lua**
